✅ 1. DATA CLEANING TRANSFORMATIONS

These are basic cleanup ETL steps to make the dataset usable:

(A) Standardize Organization Names

Trim whitespace

Normalize case (title or upper)

Deduplicate slight variants (“TD Bank” vs. “TD”)

(B) Standardize Job Title

Normalize case

Extract seniority level (Intern, Junior, New Grad, etc.)

(C) Unify Date Formats

Convert DATE OF APPLICATION to date type

Add a yyyy-MM column (useful for month-wise stats)

(D) Standardize Location Field

Split into:

city

province/state

country (infer default if missing)

Normalize formatting

(E) Boolean Normalization
Columns like:

INTERVIEW SCHEDULED

FOLLOW-UP EMAIL
…become True/False or Y/N.

(F) Missing Value Treatment
Fill nulls for:

contact info → "N/A"

link → "N/A"

follow-up → "Pending"

📦 2. ENRICHMENT / DERIVED FIELDS (ADDED COLUMNS)

These transformations produce useful new columns.

(1) Derived Employment Type
From “TYPE OF EMPLOYMENT” derive standardized enums:

Full-time / Part-time / Internship / Co-op / New Grad / Hybrid / Remote / On-site


(2) Seniority Extraction
From job title:

Examples:

Software Developer Intern → Intern
Software Developer, New Grad → New Grad
Backend Engineer → Mid-level (default)


(3) Time-based Metrics
Create columns:

days_since_application

week_of_year

month

quarter

(4) Job Platform Extraction
From link:

Workday, Greenhouse, Lever, Direct, Email


Detect using hostname parsing.

(5) Contact Presence Flag

has_recruiter_contact = contact_info != null


(6) Follow-up Strategy Fields
From status:

need_follow_up = (Interview is null) AND (days_since_application > 7)


(7) Stage Classification
Define funnel stages:

Applied → In Review → Interview → Offer → Rejected


(If not tracked, you can add as manual editable column)

📊 3. ANALYTICAL & AGGREGATION TRANSFORMATIONS

This is the “insight” layer.

Transformations include:

A. Count-based Aggregations

Group by:

company

job title

city

employment type

date/month

Examples:

applications_per_month
applications_per_company
applications_per_city
applications_by_platform

B. Funnel Metrics

If you add pipeline stages, aggregate:

conversion_rate = interviews / applications
offer_rate = offers / interviews

C. Timing Metrics

Useful for optimization:

average_days_to_interview
average_days_between_follow-ups

D. Platform Effectiveness

Measure success by job board:

interview_rate_by_platform
offer_rate_by_platform

E. Salary Estimation (optional)

If you enrich via external APIs (Glassdoor, Levels.fyi)

🗺 4. DIMENSIONAL MODELING (OPTIONAL — FOR WAREHOUSE)

For ETL pipelines, you can restructure into:

Fact table
fact_job_applications
  - application_id
  - date_id
  - job_id
  - org_id
  - location_id
  - platform_id
  - stage
  - follow_up_done
  - interview_flag

Dimension tables
dim_job
dim_organization
dim_location
dim_platform
dim_date


This allows BI tools (Superset/PowerBI) integrations later.

🎯 5. POTENTIAL INSIGHTS EXPECTED

Once the above transformations exist, insights become possible:

✔ Which companies actually respond?
✔ Which posting platforms lead to interviews?
✔ Which cities have better hit rates?
✔ Best time-of-year to apply?
✔ Does follow-up increase interview probability?
✔ How long before companies reply?

Example insight output:

Applications sent: 128
Interviews received: 7
Conversion: 5.4%
Best month: January (18 applications, 3 interviews)
Most effective platform: LinkedIn (12% conversion)
Most responsive location: Toronto

If You Want, I Can Also Provide:

✔ The PySpark ETL code for these transformations
✔ The schema planning for the CSV
✔ A dashboard design for insights
✔ A cloud pipeline plan (S3 + Glue + Athena + Quicksight / Snowflake)
